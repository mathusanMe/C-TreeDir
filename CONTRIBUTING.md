We choose to follow the rules given here to keep consistency between our projects.

## Language

English will be used for function names, variable names, class names, and comments.

## Coding Standards

### General

- Any magic number must be defined in a constant _e.g._

```c
// Bad
if (array->size == 3)
{
    // ...
}

// Good
define ARRAY_SIZE = 3;

if (array->size == ARRAY_SIZE)
{
    // ...
}

```

### Functions

- Single Responsibility Principle (`SRP`): A function should have only one goal, otherwise decompose into at least two functions
- The length of a function should not exceed 30 lines
- No more than 3/4 arguments in a function
- A condition composed of more than 2 conditions should be decomposed into several functions _e.g._

```c
// Bad
if (condition1 && condition2 && condition3 && condition4)
{
    // ...
}

// Good
if (isInputValid())
{
    // ...
}

bool isInputValid() {
    return condition1 && condition2 && condition3 && condition4;
}
```

- Any unused functions (i.e., not used) should be removed. Dead code is not allowed in the project. It can always be found in the Github history.

### Classes

- Small and powerful classes are expected.
- Functions should be placed as close as possible to their use and following the calling/called convention _e.g._

```c
// Bad
void g ()
{
    f();
}

void h()
{
    // ...
}

void f()
{
    // ...
}

// Good
void h()
{
    // ...
}

void g ()
{
    f();
}

void f()
{
    // ...
}

```

### Comments

- Comments should be used to explain why and not how _e.g._

```c
// Bad
int time = 0; // Time

// Good
int time = 0; // Time in seconds since the beginning of the game

```

- A documentation is expected (except for trivial functions)

### Variable Names

- Sensible names are necessary for functions and variables _e.g._

  - `isOK` -> `isValidInput`
  - `name` -> `PlayerName`
  - `i` -> `column`
  - `j` -> `row`

  ...

### Tests

- Any code that is not tested will not be accepted
- The name of the test text file must be `input` followed by a positive number

- Tests are expected for the majority of functions
- It is expected that tests be independent of each other (no dependency between tests)
- One test per function and per test case is expected, _e.g._

```c

void testGetAllWithEmptyList()
{
    // ...
}

void TestGetAllWithNonEmptyList()
{
    // ...
}
```

## GitHub Standards

### Branches

- Branch naming follows the convention: `Issue#-ShortIssueName` e.g. `1-CreateProject`
- No commits will be tolerated on `develop` and `master` branches
- A merge `develop` -> `master` is expected at a minimum of one sprint every two sprints
- The only branch that can be merged into Master is the `develop` branch

### Merge Requests

- Confirmation with a üëç from at least more than a half of the group is expected before any `MR` is merged
- Verify that your code passes each test before submitting an `MR`

### Issues

#### Update your issues

We try to update our issues as often as possible. Regular updates allow us to observe a certain work pace and identify possible difficulties encountered.

#### Short issues

An issue created should at best correspond to a work limit associated with a half-sprint duration. If this is not the case, the issue has been poorly thought out and it is then preferable to revise its design or simply divide it into several smaller issues.

#### Precise labels

It should be possible to understand the usefulness and interest of an issue only through its title and the labels assigned to it.

#### Categories

##### Issue Status

- To Do
- On Hold
- WIP
- To Review

##### Issue Type

- Bug
- Advancement Status
